/// # The Internals - How Box construct and destruct the *dyn* type
/// ## Construction
/// `Box` construct the `dyn T` using the following two steps
/// - construct the T on the heap which means allocate memory on heap and construct it in place
/// - construct a "fat pointer" that consist of two normal pointers, one is pointed to `T` itself and the other is pointed to the `vtable` of `T`
/// - after all this is done, store the "fat pointer" into Box itself, it now contains only the "fat pointer" and can be moved safely
/// ## Destruction
/// this happens will a `Box` goes out of its scope means `drop` of `Box` will be called, this has two steps
/// - `Box` extract second part the `vtable` pointer and find a `drop` method in it, then call it with first part pointer of `T`, like this: `drop(self)`
/// - finally `Box` will try to free the memory of `T` occupied
/// 
/// # NoteWorthy
/// - the drop progress of a `Box` may changed depends on `T`, as we can see a `dyn` type is "special" in construction / destruction of a `Box`.
/// non-dyn types are easy to construct & destruct
/// - a `*mut dyn T` type do not has the same memory layout of a regular raw pointer(*mut _), it is just a syntax sugar for "a pointer to a dyn type"
/// it essentailly occupy 16 bytes in memory, the same as `&mut dyn T`, but this is not the case as `*mut &dyn T` which is treat same as a raw pointer,
/// that is why we can get variable of `&mut dyn T` that occupy 16 bytes on stack while we can get a raw pointer variable of `*mut &dyn T` that points to it
